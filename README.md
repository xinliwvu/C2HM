The ZIP file contains a GenAI-based implementation of inverted inference for the paper titled "Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine: Goal-Seeded Simulation via Inverted Inference".
Each notebook file (.ipynb) should be self-contained and running each can reproduce the experimental results reported in the above paper (Table 1 and Figs. 1-5).
